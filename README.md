Now, I am currently a master student in the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn) at the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://ustc.edu.cn). I am a member of the [Advanced Computer Systems Architecture (ACSA) Laboratory](https://acsa.ustc.edu.cn), which is led by [Professor Hong An](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn/2020/0426/c23235a460072/page.htm). Before that, I obtained my bachelor‚Äôs degree in Computer Science from Northwest A&F University in 2023. During my undergraduate studies, I joined the Parallel and Visual Processing Laboratory led by [Professor Bin Liu](https://cie.nwsuaf.edu.cn/szdw/js/2014110093/index.htm).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **high-performance computing**, 
**machine learning systems**, and **distributed training**. Specifically, I focus on:

- **Gradient Compression Algorithms:** Developing efficient compression techniques to reduce communication overhead in distributed training
- **Large-scale Distributed Systems:** Building scalable solutions for training foundation models on HPC clusters

**Now, I am seeking related PhD opportunities in 2026 Fall üçÇüçÇüçÇ**
