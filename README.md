I am currently a master student in the [School of Computer Science and Technology](https://cs.ustc.edu.cn) at the [University of Science and Technology of China(USTC)](https://ustc.edu.cn/). I primarily conduct research in high-performance computing, machine learning systems, and distributed training.

Specially, I am focusing on the "Gradient Compression" algorithm in distributed training.

**Now, I am seeking related PhD opportunities.**
